Laravel application to illustrate my [presentation](presentation.pdf "Slides") (in French) about PHP collections.

Examples are all artisan [commands](https://github.com/osteel/php-collections-presentation/tree/master/app/Console/Commands).

E.g. to run the example to find the strongest pokemon:

```
$ php artisan strongest
```

If you are not sure how to run this project locally, have a look at [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/master/homestead).
